# Journeys — synthesized from the diff, anchored by Relaticle CRM priors

The unit of review is a **journey**: a user-facing value arc the diff affects. The
`journey-synthesizer` agent derives this run's journeys from (1) the diff's touched
surfaces (`classify_diff.py` output) and (2) the project profile. The **priors below are
anchors, not a ceiling**: synthesize a journey for every changed surface no prior covers,
and skip priors the diff doesn't touch.

## Relaticle journey priors (J-ids; use as templates when the diff touches their arc)

| id | arc | personas | characteristic seams + sad paths |
|---|---|---|---|
| J1 | Sign up / log in → land on team dashboard | guest→team-owner | wrong password, unverified email, post-login redirect target, session expiry mid-form (419 retry) |
| J2 | Create/edit a CRM record (company/person/opportunity/task/note) with custom fields | team-owner, team-member | required-empty, special chars/emoji, custom-field round-trip per type, double-submit, cancel button |
| J3 | Pipeline: move opportunity through stages (kanban) | team-owner | drag to stage, server error rollback, empty stage, stage with WIP rules |
| J4 | Import CSV → records (wizard) | team-owner | invalid rows surfaced (REG-003 empty name), type coercion, dry-run vs commit, resume mid-wizard, custom-field columns |
| J5 | AI chat: prompt → tool proposal → approve → record mutated | team-owner | insufficient credits, reject proposal, batch proposals, approval after reload, composer alive after N messages (REG-005), credit ledger debit pairing |
| J6 | Team & tenancy: invite member, switch team, cross-team isolation | team-owner, team-member | deep-link to other team's record → 403/404, custom-field isolation (REG-004), member-permission boundaries |
| J7 | REST API consume: token → CRUD + QueryBuilder filters | api-consumer | 401 without token, tenant scoping, validation 422, custom-fields read shape `{id,label}`, write-ignore behavior |
| J8 | Billing/credits: balance display → consumption → transaction history | team-owner, sysadmin | zero balance block + upgrade prompt, ledger pairing, **enum-rendering surfaces (REG-001)** |
| J9 | Sysadmin panel: login → resource lists render → record visibility | sysadmin | non-sysadmin denied, new enum cases render in tables (REG-001), minimal depth (internal panel) |
| J10 | Notifications/real-time: action → toast/broadcast received | team-owner | Reverb connected, toast content, auto-dismiss, stacking |

## Synthesis rules (same engine as universal — full schema in `agents/journey-synthesizer.md`)

1. **Start from touched surfaces**; group surfaces in the same value arc (form +
   controller/action + result view = ONE arc).
2. **Name the value via the profile** ("a team-owner imports companies and sees them in
   the list", not "ImportWizard changed").
3. **Happy path first, then sad paths** — ≥1 sad path per journey (≥2 at Tier 3),
   anchored on the **seam** (the hand-off where two surfaces meet under an unusual
   condition). Always include the unhappy branch of any NEW conditional in the diff.
4. **Assign personas + subsystem tokens**; mark `synthesized: true` (validator then skips
   catalog-id resolution; a prior-based journey may keep its J-id).
5. **Author → persist → consume**: when the diff touches an authoring surface (a form,
   wizard, composer), the happy path MUST drive the real save and confirm persistence —
   never substitute a pre-seeded record for the thing under test. Consumption-only
   coverage of an authoring change is the dodge `validate_plan` exists to reject.
6. **Regression checks ride journeys**: every matched `regression-checks.json` entry is
   attached to the journey covering its surface (or gets a dedicated micro-journey).
   The plan frontmatter lists `regression_checks: [{id, journey, status}]`.

## Generic sad-path heuristics (apply whichever fit; the seam decides)

empty/invalid/oversized input · steps out of order · destructive-then-recreate ·
permission/tenant boundary crossing (mandatory — multi-tenant app) · duplicate/
double-submit · abandon-and-return mid-flow · the unhappy branch of every new conditional.

## Hard rules

- Every journey's `surfaces` must contain ≥1 real touched file/route from the diff —
  no faked breadth. Don't synthesize arcs the product doesn't have.
- Infra-only diff (no user-facing surface): synthesize none, emit `no_surface_reason`,
  verdict path is an honest `ai-needs-human` (no test-suite fallback exists).
- Every journey ≥1 sad path; a happy-only journey has not been reviewed.

Output: `$REVIEW_DIR/journey-map.json`, folded into plan frontmatter, validated by
`scripts/validate_plan.py` before the fleet launches.

## Plan-frontmatter schema (canonical — write it right the first time)

The exact field names `validate_plan.py` + `aggregate_verdicts.py` consume (guessing
them cost the 2026-06-12 run three validation round-trips):

```json
{
  "pr_number": 336, "sha": "<full-sha>", "tier": 2, "channel": "healthy",
  "computed_tier": 3,
  "tier_rationale": "required when tier != computed_tier (quote signal_evidence lines)",
  "persona_rationale": "required when tier >= 2 and distinct personas < 2",
  "changed_surfaces": [
    {"id": "Tasks board (/tasks/board)",
     "covered_by": ["tasks-view-switching"],
     "kind": "authoring",
     "reachable": true,
     "primary": true,
     "gated_by": "pennant:new-boards"}
  ],
  "preconditions_activated": [{"gate": "pennant:new-boards", "attested": true}],
  "journeys": [
    {"id": "tasks-view-switching", "name": "Tasks list/board switching",
     "synthesized": true,
     "personas": ["team-owner"],
     "happy_path": ["step 1", "step 2"],
     "sad_paths": ["deep-link /tasks/board directly"],
     "acs": [2, 3],
     "covers_surfaces": ["Tasks board (/tasks/board)"]}
  ],
  "regression_checks": [{"id": "REG-001", "journey": "tasks-view-switching", "status": "planned"}]
}
```

Field notes: surface key is `id` (not `surface`); `covered_by` takes a list (bare string
accepted, normalized); `happy_path` is a LIST of steps, never a prose string; every
journey needs `name`; `acs` are ints from acceptance-criteria.json (or `"implicit"`);
`kind: "authoring"` surfaces can never be `reachable: false`; an unreached
`primary: true` surface blocks the verdict; `gated_by` pairs with a
`preconditions_activated` entry `{gate, attested: true}`.
