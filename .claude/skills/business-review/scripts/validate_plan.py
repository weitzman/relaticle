"""Validate a business-review plan.md's journey-based JSON frontmatter.

Usage:
    python3 validate_plan.py <path-to-plan.md>
    python3 validate_plan.py --test

Exits: 0 valid, 1 validation/parse error, 2 bad usage.

Substance gates enforced (not just JSON shape):
  - tier present and in 0..3; channel in {healthy, degraded}
  - journeys non-empty, OR journeys empty WITH a top-level no_surface_reason
  - every journey: id, personas (non-empty), happy_path (non-empty), sad_paths (list), acs (list)
  - tier >= 2  =>  every journey has >=1 sad_path   (forbids happy-path-only on broad/critical PRs)
  - AC ids in journeys resolve against acceptance-criteria.json
  - journey ids resolve against references/journeys.json IF that manifest exists (else a warning),
    UNLESS the journey is marked "synthesized": true — a journey derived for this diff (Move A),
    which earns its place by substance, not catalog membership
  - changed_surfaces (opt-in): every user-reachable changed surface is covered by some journey
    (Move A), and every gated changed surface has an attested precondition that activates its
    gate (Move B). A plan without changed_surfaces is unaffected (back-compat).

Companion files looked up next to plan.md:
  - acceptance-criteria.json (required)
The journeys manifest is looked up at <skill>/references/journeys.json relative to this script.

Pure stdlib.
