# Architecture

Relaticle is a modular monolith: the CRM core lives in `app/`, and self-contained
subsystems live in `packages/<Name>/` with the `Relaticle\<Name>` namespace
(autoloaded from `packages/<Name>/src` via the root composer.json — packages have
no composer.json of their own). Service providers are registered in
`bootstrap/providers.php`.

| Location | Owns |
|---|---|
| `app/` | CRM domain: models, actions, Filament app panel, API, MCP server |
| `packages/Chat` | AI assistant (agents, chat tools, credit system, streaming) |
| `packages/SystemAdmin` | Internal admin panel (separate Filament panel) |
| `packages/ImportWizard` | CSV import flows |
| `packages/Documentation` | Public docs pages |
| `packages/OnboardSeed` | Demo/onboarding data seeding |

Create a new package only for a genuinely separable subsystem with its own panel,
routes, or lifecycle — not for a new CRM entity (those go in `app/`). Package
anatomy mirrors a Laravel app: `src/`, `config/`, `routes/`, `resources/`,
`database/`.

## Module boundaries (enforced by tests/Arch/ArchTest.php)

- `App` must not depend on `Relaticle\SystemAdmin`; `Relaticle\SystemAdmin` may
  only reach back into `App\Models`, `App\Enums`, `App\Rules`
- Never use the custom-fields package models directly — use the `App\Models\CustomField*`
  subclasses (runtime model swapping is configured in `AppServiceProvider`)
- `packages/SystemAdmin` is excluded from PHPStan — when adding or removing enum
  cases, manually sweep SystemAdmin for `match` expressions over that enum (this
  exclusion already caused a production `UnhandledMatchError`)

## Actions (the write path)

All write operations (create, update, delete) go through action classes in
`app/Actions/<Domain>/` — never inline business logic in controllers, MCP tools,
Livewire components, or Filament resources. Actions are the single source of
truth for business logic and side effects (notifications, syncs, etc.).

The canonical shape — `final readonly`, a single `execute()` method, authorization
and tenant-ownership checks inside the action itself:

```php
final readonly class CreateOpportunity
{
    public function execute(User $user, array $data, CreationSource $source = CreationSource::WEB): Opportunity
    {
        abort_unless($user->can('create', Opportunity::class), 403);

        TenantFkValidator::assertOwned($user, $data, [...]);
        // ...
    }
}
```

- Enforced by `EloquentWriteOutsideActionRule` (PHPStan): Eloquent writes in
  controllers, MCP tools, Livewire components, Filament classes, or chat tools
  fail analysis. Pre-existing violations are grandfathered per-file in
  `phpstan.neon` — when you refactor one, remove its ignore entry
- Filament CRUD may use native `CreateAction`/`EditAction` when the operation is a
  plain `Model::create()`/`->update()` with no extra logic — but side effects
  (e.g., notifications) must still be triggered via `->after()` hooks calling the
  appropriate action
- When reviewing or refactoring code, extract inline business logic into action classes
- Use `App\Data` (spatie/laravel-data) objects for structured payloads where they
  already exist; don't introduce new patterns
- Name domain concepts plainly (`Plan`, not `AiPlan`) — context comes from the
  namespace. Never store the same fact in two places; pick one source of truth

## i18n enforcement

Two custom PHPStan rules (`app/PHPStan/Rules/`) forbid hardcoded user-facing
strings: `HardcodedUserFacingStringRule` (guarded methods like `label()`,
`heading()`, `title()`) and `HardcodedStaticPropertyRule` (guarded static
properties like `$navigationLabel`). Wrap user-facing strings in `__()`.
Some paths are deferred via explicit ignores in `phpstan.neon` — don't add new
ignores without approval.

=== .ai/chat rules ===

# Chat

## Verifying chat changes

Chat features MUST be verified against the production-shaped stack before being
reported done: Horizon running, `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis` (not sync), Reverb up,
and the full loop walked in a real browser (send → stream → proposal card →
approve/reject). Sync-queue testing masks exactly the bug class that reaches
production: message ordering, approval races, duplicate proposals.

- When a production chat transcript is given as a bug report, enumerate every
  defective turn as a separate defect (ordering, duplicate/stale proposal cards,
  rate-limit UX, wrong success messages), reproduce each locally, and track them
  as a checklist — never fix only the most visible one.
- When one chat tool has a bug, sweep its sibling Create/Update/Delete tools for
  the same class of bug before closing.

## Tool design

- Prefer giving the agent a tool (e.g. `ListTeamMembersTool`) over injecting
  tenant data into the system prompt — add prompt-context injection only when a
  tool round-trip is demonstrably too costly.
- New write tools must support batch input like the delete path (`ids[]` /
  multi-record proposals → one `PendingAction`, all-or-nothing) — do not add new
  scalar-only tools.
- A field reachable in the Filament form must be settable from chat; the
  assistant answering "that field isn't supported" is a bug, not a limitation
  to document.

## Chat tools + custom fields

Chat tools (`packages/Chat/src/Tools/*/Create*Tool.php` and `Update*Tool.php`) automatically support **every** active custom field for their entity. Adding a new field to `app/Enums/CustomFields/*Field.php` (or via the Custom Fields admin UI) is enough — do NOT add per-field schema slots, value coercion, or display rows to the chat tool. The bridge services in `packages/Chat/src/Services/Tools/` handle:

- Inlining a per-tenant `custom_fields` schema description so the LLM knows the valid codes and option labels.
- Translating option labels back to option IDs at validation time.
- Formatting the proposal-card "old → new" diff per field type.

If you need a custom field to be **un-settable** from chat, mark it `active=false` on the `custom_fields` row, or add a tool-side allowlist filter inside `CustomFieldsSchemaDescriber`. Don't reach for hand-rolled per-field code.

=== .ai/core rules ===

# Project

This is production code for a commercial SaaS product with paying customers.
Bugs directly impact revenue and user trust.

Treat every change like it's going through senior code review:

- No lazy shortcuts or placeholder code
- Handle errors and edge cases properly
- Write code that won't embarrass you in 6 months

## Database

- This project uses **PostgreSQL exclusively** — do not add SQLite/MySQL compatibility layers, driver checks, or conditional SQL
- Migrations must only have `up()` methods — do not write `down()` methods

## Pre-Commit Quality Checks

Before committing any changes, always run these checks in order:

1. `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` — fix code style
2. `vendor/bin/rector --dry-run` — if rector suggests changes, apply them with `vendor/bin/rector`
3. `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` — ensure no new static analysis errors
4. `composer test:type-coverage` — type coverage must stay at 100%
5. `php artisan test --compact` — run relevant tests (use `--filter` for targeted runs)

Do not add new PHPStan ignores without approval. All parameters and return types must be explicitly typed — untyped closures/parameters will fail type coverage in CI.

## Fixing & Verification

- Never change production code solely to make a test or CI pass. A failing check
  means one of: production bug, wrong assertion, or test-state leak — diagnose
  which first, then fix at that layer. A production behavior change must be
  justified on its own merits and covered by its own dedicated test.
- After any fix, re-run the original failing repro (test, browser flow, query)
  and show the new output before claiming it is fixed. "Should work now" is not done.
- Before reporting an investigation or cleanup complete, do a second independent
  verification pass: re-grep all references, re-run the checks, re-walk the repro.
- Debug production errors by reproducing them locally first (failing test, seeded
  data, or browser repro with the real queue). Production access (Tinkerwell/SSH)
  is for short read-only queries that capture the failing payload or state —
  never the iteration loop.
- When a failing operation has a working sibling (approve vs reject, one entity
  type vs another), diff the two code paths first — it is the fastest localizer.

## Minimal Change

- Default to the smallest change that satisfies the requirement. Every new file,
  script, DB column, or abstraction must be justified by an explicit need — when
  in doubt, leave it out and propose it instead.
- Internal contracts (chat tool schemas, action signatures, internal APIs) have
  no external consumers — when extending one, migrate all callers in the same
  change. Never leave deprecated parameters, fallbacks, or dual old/new paths.
- Environment-specific developer data belongs in `database/seeders/LocalSeeder.php` —
  never as `app()->environment()` branches inside `app/Actions/` or other
  production code.

## Scheduling

- All scheduled commands go in `bootstrap/app.php` via `withSchedule()` — not in `routes/console.php`

=== .ai/custom-fields rules ===

# Custom Fields

- Models using the `UsesCustomFields` trait handle `custom_fields` automatically — do NOT manually extract, strip, or call `saveCustomFields()` in actions
- The trait merges `'custom_fields'` into `$fillable`, intercepts it during `saving`, and persists values during `saved` — just pass `custom_fields` through in the `$data` array to `create()`/`update()`
- Tenant context for the custom-fields package is set in `SetApiTeamContext` middleware via `TenantContextService::setTenantId()` — actions don't need `withTenant()` wrappers
- In Filament, the package's own `SetTenantContextMiddleware` handles tenant context — no action-level code needed there either
- `CustomFieldValidationService` intentionally uses explicit `where('tenant_id', ...)` with `withoutGlobalScopes()` — this is defensive and correct, don't change it to rely on ambient state
- Every write path that is NOT a Filament panel request or behind `SetApiTeamContext` (chat action approval, queued jobs, webhooks, commands) must set `TenantContextService::setTenantId()` before saving custom fields — otherwise `saveCustomFields` iterates every tenant (gateway timeouts + cross-tenant writes). Wrap manual calls in try/finally restoring the previous tenant id (mirror `SetApiTeamContext`)
- Writing null/empty for a custom field is how a value is cleared — never skip or filter out "empty" values on save; only keys absent from the payload are left untouched. Verify any persistence change in both directions (set a value AND clear it), through both the panel form and the chat/API path

=== .ai/testing rules ===

# Testing

The suite follows the Testing Trophy. Every test file must live inside one of
these directories — they are the phpunit testsuites, and
`tests/Arch/TestSuiteIntegrityTest.php` fails if a `*Test.php` exists anywhere
else (files outside a declared suite silently never run):

| Layer | Directory | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | `tests/Arch/` | structural rules, module boundaries |
| PHPStan rules | `tests/PHPStan/` | tests for the custom static-analysis rules |
| Smoke | `tests/Smoke/` | HTTP-level route smoke |
| Workflow | `tests/Feature/` | the bulk of the suite — test through real entry points |
| Browser | `tests/Browser/` | critical paths only |

There is deliberately **no `tests/Unit/` suite**. Do not create new top-level
test directories; if one is ever needed, declare it in BOTH `phpunit.xml` and
`phpunit.ci.xml` (kept in sync — also enforced by `TestSuiteIntegrityTest`).

## Rules

- Do not write isolated unit tests for action classes, services, enums, or other
  internal code — test them through their real entry points (API endpoints,
  Filament resources, Livewire components). Isolated unit tests of internals
  create maintenance burden without catching real bugs.
- Never weaken an assertion, delete a test, or special-case production code just
  to turn the suite green. If a test asserts a stale value, fix the assertion;
  if state leaks between tests, fix isolation in the test layer — don't push
  compensation into production code.
- Never write tests that assert on source code as text (reading a Blade/PHP file
  and checking it contains a string). They break on refactors and pass on broken
  behavior — test the rendered/runtime behavior instead.
- `tests/Pest.php` binds `TestCase` + `LazilyRefreshDatabase` for the Feature,
  Smoke, and Browser suites — don't repeat `uses(...)` per file there.
- Use `mutates(ClassName::class)` in test files to declare which source classes
  each test covers
- Run mutation testing per-class as a code-review tool (no CI gate):
  `php -d xdebug.mode=coverage vendor/bin/pest --mutate --class='App\MyClass' tests/path/`
- Use `$this->travelTo()` in tests that depend on day-of-week or weekly intervals
  to avoid flaky boundary failures
- Match test organization to existing conventions: before creating a test file,
  search `tests/` for files covering the same class or feature and extend those

=== .ai/ui rules ===

# UI

## Verifying visual work

- Verify every visual change with an agent-browser screenshot (light + dark, and
  mobile viewport where relevant) before reporting it done — never make the user
  act as the renderer.
- Any change to a Blade view, Livewire component, or Filament page must be
  clicked through with agent-browser (including empty-state data) before being
  reported done — tests passing is not sufficient for UI work.

## Marketing & demo surfaces

- Mockups of the product (hero tabs, demos) mirror the real app UI 1:1 —
  screenshot the actual app first and match sidebar, spacing, and component
  placement. External sites (e.g. attio.com) are inspiration for concept only,
  never for visual specifics.
- Use design tokens from `resources/css/theme.css`; don't introduce ad-hoc pixel
  values or colors without a semantic token.
- Demo/example content (names, companies, conversations) must read like real CRM
  data for the buyer persona — no placeholder-looking values.

## Icons (Remix Icon)

- **Brand/social icons** (GitHub, Discord, Twitter, LinkedIn) → always `fill` variant
- **UI/functional icons** (arrows, chevrons, checks, close) → always `line` variant
- **Feature/section icons** → `line` variant, stay consistent within a section
- **Status/emphasis icons** (success checkmarks, alerts) → `fill` variant

=== .ai/workflow rules ===

# Workflow

## Decisions

- For design decisions, present numbered/lettered options with a comparison
  matrix and one clear recommendation. Batch independent questions so they can
  all be answered in a single message; expect one-character answers.

## Guidelines pipeline

- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `GEMINI.md` are compiled artifacts — edit the
  sources in `.ai/guidelines/relaticle/`, then run `php artisan boost:update`
  and copy `AGENTS.md` to `GEMINI.md` (boost does not write it). Never edit the
  compiled files directly; `tests/Arch/ConventionsTest.php` fails when they drift.

## Releases

- Merge to main and tag only on explicit instruction — never on your own.
- Procedure: merge → `git checkout main && git pull` → confirm local and remote
  parity (`git log origin/main..main` and the reverse are both empty) → tag
  `vX.Y.Z` (minor for features, patch for fixes) → `git push origin <tag>`.

## External communication

- PR/issue comments, Discord replies, and any other outbound text: show the
  draft and wait for an explicit "post" before publishing.
- Never claim a product capability (in PR bodies, replies, docs) without
  verifying it works in the current codebase — feature claims must be backed by
  code or a browser repro.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== herd rules ===

# Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd at `https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test`. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate valid URLs. Never run commands to serve the site. It is always available.
- Use the `herd` CLI to manage services, PHP versions, and sites (e.g. `herd sites`, `herd services:start <service>`, `herd php:list`). Run `herd list` to discover all available commands.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allow to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is a Laravel UI framework built on Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS. UIs are defined in PHP via fluent, chainable components. Follow existing conventions in this app.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for official documentation on Artisan commands, code examples, testing, relationships, and idiomatic practices. If `search-docs` is unavailable, refer to https://filamentphp.com/docs.

### Artisan

- Always use Filament-specific Artisan commands to create files. Find available commands with the `list-artisan-commands` tool, or run `php artisan --help`.
- Inspect required options before running, and always pass `--no-interaction`.

### Patterns

Always use static `make()` methods to initialize components. Most configuration methods accept a `Closure` for dynamic values.

Use `Get $get` to read other form field values for conditional logic:

<code-snippet name="Conditional form field visibility" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('type')
    ->options(CompanyType::class)
    ->required()
    ->live(),

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->required()
    ->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('type') === 'business'),

</code-snippet>

Use `Set $set` inside `->afterStateUpdated()` on a `->live()` field to mutate another field reactively. Prefer `->live(onBlur: true)` on text inputs to avoid per-keystroke updates:

<code-snippet name="Reactive field update" lang="php">
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

TextInput::make('title')
    ->required()
    ->live(onBlur: true)
    ->afterStateUpdated(fn (Set $set, ?string $state) => $set(
        'slug',
        Str::slug($state ?? ''),
    )),

TextInput::make('slug')
    ->required(),

</code-snippet>

Compose layout by nesting `Section` and `Grid`. Children need explicit `->columnSpan()` or `->columnSpanFull()`:

<code-snippet name="Section and Grid layout" lang="php">
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Details')
    ->schema([
        Grid::make(2)->schema([
            TextInput::make('first_name')
                ->columnSpan(1),
            TextInput::make('last_name')
                ->columnSpan(1),
            TextInput::make('bio')
                ->columnSpanFull(),
        ]),
    ]),

</code-snippet>

Use `Repeater` for inline `HasMany` management. `->relationship()` with no args binds to the relationship matching the field name:

<code-snippet name="Repeater for HasMany" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('institution')
            ->required(),
        TextInput::make('qualification')
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->columns(2),

</code-snippet>

Use `state()` with a `Closure` to compute derived column values:

<code-snippet name="Computed table column value" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->state(fn (User $record): string => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}"),

</code-snippet>

Use `SelectFilter` for enum or relationship filters, and `Filter` with a `->query()` closure for custom logic:

<code-snippet name="Table filters" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options(UserStatus::class),

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name'),

Filter::make('verified')
    ->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at')),

</code-snippet>

Actions are buttons that encapsulate optional modal forms and behavior:

<code-snippet name="Action with modal form" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateEmail')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->email()
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->action(fn (array $data, User $record) => $record->update($data)),

</code-snippet>

### Testing

Testing setup (requires `pestphp/pest-plugin-livewire` in `composer.json`):

- Always call `$this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())` before testing panel functionality.
- For edit pages, pass `['record' => $user->id]`, use `->call('save')` (not `->call('create')`), and do not assert `->assertRedirect()` (edit pages do not redirect after save).

<code-snippet name="Table test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)

Use `->callAction(DeleteAction::class)` for page actions, or `->callAction(TestAction::make('name')->table($record))` for table actions:

<code-snippet name="Calling actions" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('promote')->table($user), [
        'role' => 'admin',
    ])
    ->assertNotified();

</code-snippet>

### Correct Namespaces

- Form fields (`TextInput`, `Select`, `Repeater`, etc.): `Filament\Forms\Components\`
- Infolist entries (`TextEntry`, `IconEntry`, etc.): `Filament\Infolists\Components\`
- Layout components (`Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, `Tabs`, `Wizard`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\`
- Schema utilities (`Get`, `Set`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\`
- Table columns (`TextColumn`, `IconColumn`, etc.): `Filament\Tables\Columns\`
- Table filters (`SelectFilter`, `Filter`, etc.): `Filament\Tables\Filters\`
- Actions (`DeleteAction`, `CreateAction`, etc.): `Filament\Actions\`. Never use `Filament\Tables\Actions\`, `Filament\Forms\Actions\`, or any other sub-namespace for actions.
- Icons: `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` enum (e.g., `Heroicon::PencilSquare`)

### Common Mistakes

- **Never assume public file visibility.** File visibility is `private` by default. Always use `->visibility('public')` when public access is needed.
- **Never assume full-width layout.** `Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, and `Repeater` do not span all columns by default.
- **Use `Select::make('author_id')->relationship('author', 'name')` for BelongsTo fields.** `BelongsToSelect` does not exist in v4.
- **`Repeater` uses `->schema()`, not `->fields()`.**
- **Never add `->dehydrated(false)` to fields that need to be saved.** It strips the value from form state before `->action()` or the save handler runs. Only use it for helper/UI-only fields.
- **Use correct property types when overriding `Page`, `Resource`, and `Widget` properties.** These properties have union types or changed modifiers that must be preserved:
  - `$navigationIcon`: `protected static string | BackedEnum | null` (not `?string`)
  - `$navigationGroup`: `protected static string | UnitEnum | null` (not `?string`)
  - `$view`: `protected string` (not `protected static string`) on `Page` and `Widget` classes
